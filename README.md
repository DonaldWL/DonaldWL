If you have any questions concerning what I have posted on github feel free to drop me aline.

One of the projects I am playing with is a state machine generator.  You can find it at 
DonaldWL/StateMachine.  It will help you understand state machines.  I have written a lot of
protocols in the past using state machines.  You will find that it supports C, CPP, Java, CSharp, 
and Python.  It does not generate your code its just to help generate all the tables that you
will require.  It has examples and templates.  Let me know what you think about it, its manly for
learning but you can use it for a real world application if you desire.
